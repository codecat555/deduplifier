Just got the postgres db connection working (postgres listening on 5432, which is mapped to 6881 on the vm host and 6881 on the main host (the host on which the host vm runs).

From the main host (nuage):

    me@nuage:~/Documents/dev$ psql -h 10.127.208.171 -p 6881 -U postgres deduplifier

From the main host, connect on the libvirt vm host :

    me@nuage:~/Documents/dev/deduplifier$ multipass exec deduplifier-host -- psql -h localhost -p 6881 -U postgres deduplifier

From the main host, connect on the libvirt vm host via docker:

    me@nuage:~/Documents/dev/deduplifier$ multipass exec deduplifier-host -- sudo docker exec -it code_db_1 psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres deduplifier
